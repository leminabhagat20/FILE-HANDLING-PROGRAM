1. File Handling in C (Create, Read, Write, Append)
This program taught me how to handle files using C. File handling is important because it allows programs to save data permanently on the disk. In this program, I used functions like fopen(), fprintf(), fscanf(), and fclose() to create a new file, write data to it, read data from it, and also append additional content to the same file. The process starts by opening a file with a specific mode like “w” (write), “r” (read), or “a” (append). If the file doesn't exist, it's created. I learned how to check if a file opened successfully, and how to safely close it after operations. This program gave me a clear idea of how real-world applications like notepads or log files work behind the scenes.

2. Singly Linked List (Insertion, Deletion, Traversal)
In this program, I implemented a singly linked list, a common data structure used to store a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically without wasting memory. I created a structure for a node that contains a value and a pointer to the next node. I implemented basic operations like:

Insertion (at the beginning, end, or a specific position),

Deletion (removing a node), and

Traversal (printing all node values).

This exercise helped me understand pointers and dynamic memory allocation using malloc() and free(). It also improved my logic building skills for managing node connections properly.

3. Simple Lexical Analyzer in C
A lexical analyzer is the first step in a compiler that breaks down code into meaningful parts like keywords, identifiers, and operators. In this program, I built a simple lexer that reads a string (like a line of C code) and checks if each word or character is a keyword (like int, if), an operator (like +, =, *), or an identifier (like variable names). I used basic string functions and strcmp() to match words with predefined keywords. This program gave me a taste of how compilers start processing code, and it showed me how programming languages are analyzed before being executed.

4. Run-Length Encoding (RLE) Compression
This final program focused on a simple but effective data compression technique called Run-Length Encoding (RLE). In RLE, if the same character repeats several times in a row, it's replaced with the character followed by the count. For example, aaabbb becomes a3b3. This reduces file size when there are many repeated characters. I wrote the program in a human-friendly and readable way, using loops and conditions to count repeating characters and print the compressed result. It was fun to implement and helped me understand how data can be optimized for storage or transmission.
